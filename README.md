# Hamburger-Tutorial
This is a simple implementation of a hamburger menu, which is a common UI element used to display a navigation menu in a compact space.

## Features
- Responsive design: The hamburger menu adjusts to the size of the screen and displays the navigation links in a dropdown menu on smaller screens.
- Customizable: You can easily customize the appearance of the menu by changing the colors and fonts in the CSS file.
JavaScript functionality: The JavaScript file in this project controls the behavior of the hamburger menu, including toggling the dropdown menu when the menu button is clicked.
- <b>However, the CSS file is not supposed to be so long, it is just because this is a part of my previous project which had a lot of things and while doing this I had two combine two CSS files of two of my pages from the project and they have some repetetive and also some unused CSS styles.</b>
